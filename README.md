# Natural Language Inference

## Overview
This is a simple Python project for experimenting with Natural Language Inference (NLI) — classifying pairs of sentences (premise + hypothesis) into entailment / contradiction / neutral.

The repository contains a minimal implementation of an NLI pipeline: you can feed two sentences (premise and hypothesis) and get an NLI classification. The core logic is in `main.py`.

NOTE: Natural Language Inference (NLI), also known as Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), is the task of determining whether a “hypothesis” logically follows (entailment), contradicts, or is neutral given a “premise”.
